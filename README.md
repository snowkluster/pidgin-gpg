About
-----
This is not the official branch. I'm maintianing this fork simply for
maintenence. I'm *am not* actively developing pidgin-gpg, maintly making
sure it keeps working and building. Releases > 0.9 should not be confused
with those of the original author (though the original author seems to
have stopped all development).
